## Overview

I built a landing page for essayBank using React.js and Tailwind CSS. React.js is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces, while Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework. The landing page aims to attract visitors and encourage specific actions. I designed the layout using Tailwind CSS utility classes and created reusable React components for different sections. The page is responsive, thanks to Tailwind CSS's responsive utility classes.Finally, i deployed the landing page to make it accessible online.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
